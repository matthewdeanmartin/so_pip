# This doesn't do anything for `from module import something` style imports,
# though that could easily be added, depending on how you want to deal with
# those. It also doesn't do any syntax checking, so if you have some funny
# business like `import sys gtk, os` it will think you've imported all three
# modules even though the line is an error. It also doesn't deal with
# `try`/`except` type statements with regards to import - if it could be
# imported, this function will list it. It also doesn't deal well with multiple
# imports per line if you use the `as` keyword. The real issue here is that I'd
# have to write a full parser to really do this correctly. The given code works
# in many cases, as long as you understand there are definite corner cases.
#
# One issue is that relative imports will fail if this script isn't in the same
# directory as the given file. You may want to add the directory of the given
# script to `sys.path`.
